# cavacamixa

Inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/1HwKCvsdXiw), I wrote this code to play all possible games of
"[cavacamisa](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straccia_camicia)" (="shirt off!")
the Italian (actually, from the Veneto region) variant of 
[beggar-my-neighbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggar-my-neighbour).

A similar application in C++ can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/drago-96/cavacamisa)
where the [first discovered infinite game](https://github.com/drago-96/cavacamisa/blob/e4621c57461ceeb0110f2f7f846590ee6f989c9c/infinite/20170217.txt) can be found.
